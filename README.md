# odin-recipes
This is part of the "recipes" project in The Odin Project.  So far, I have learned how to create a repository on github, how to set up git, learned some useful git commands and how to link my repository on github to my local machine so that I can make modifications to it with vscode.

In this project, I am tasked with building a simple recipe site using basic HTML and CSS, as well as Git to commit my changed code.  This exercise will serve as a nice refresher on everything I've learned thus far.
