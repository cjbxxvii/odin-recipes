        <h4>This Cuban flan recipe, a treasured gem passed down through 
            generations, stands as a testament to the rich culinary 
            heritage of Cuba. It's not just a dessert; it's a celebration 
            of culture and family. What makes this flan truly irresistible 
            is its creamy texture and the perfect balance of sweetness, 
            achieved by the unique addition of cream cheese - a twist that 
            elevates it from the ordinary. The caramel topping, lusciously 
            golden and delicately drizzled, promises a heavenly contrast to 
            the creamy custard. This recipe, steeped in tradition and perfected 
            over time, is more than just a treat; it's a delicious slice of 
            Cuban family legacy that promises to delight and inspire with 
            every bite.</h4>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>â…“ cup 2% milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, 
                cream cheese, milk, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place sugar in an even layer in a saucepan over medium heat. 
                Cook until the edges start to brown, about 1 minute; drag sugar 
                into the center with a spatula once the edges start to brown. 
                Continue cooking, stirring from time to time, until caramel is an 
                even golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, pour 1 inch boiling water into a large oven-safe pot 
                or baking dish to make a water bath.</li>
            <li>Pour caramel into a 9-inch flan mold or baking pan; swirl so 
                that caramel reaches 1 inch up the sides. Pour the condensed 
                milk mixture on top. Set in the water bath.</li>
            <li>Set the flan and water bath in the preheated oven; bake 
                until a damp table knife inserted into the center comes out 
                clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let stand 
                for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Chill flan in the refrigerator until firm, 2 to 3 hours. 
                Invert onto a serving plate so that caramel is on top.</li>
            
        
        </ol>
