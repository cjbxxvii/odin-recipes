        <h4>Ropa Vieja, a jewel in Cuban cuisine, captivates with its 
            harmonious blend of simplicity and depth. At its heart, this 
            dish is a poetic interplay of flavors and textures: tender, 
            slow-cooked beef pulls apart effortlessly, melding with the 
            sweet and mellow notes of bell peppers and onions. The rich, 
            tomato-based sauce, infused with a hint of garlic and traditional 
            spices, envelops every strand of meat, creating a comforting, 
            hearty meal. Its greatness lies in its ability to transform 
            humble ingredients into a luxurious and flavorful experience, 
            making Ropa Vieja a beloved classic that transcends time 
            and borders.</h4>

                <li>2 cups cooked Canilla Extra Long Grain Rice</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. 
                    Season meat with Adobo. Add steak to pot and cook in 
                    batches, flipping once, until well browned, about 10 
                    minutes. Transfer meat to a plate. Lower heat to medium. 
                    Stir in onions and peppers. Cook, stirring occasionally, 
                    until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add sofrito 
                    and garlic to pot; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Stir in 3 cups of water, tomato sauce, Sazon, beef bouillon 
                    and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil. Return beef to pot. 
                    Lower heat to medium low and simmer, covered, stirring 
                    occasionally, about 45 minutes. Stir in olives and capers. 
                    Cover pot; simmer until meat shreds easily with fork, 
                    1 - 1 1/2 hours, adding more water in 1/4 cup measurements, 
                    if pot becomes dry. Transfer meat to work surface; shred 
                    meat with two forks. Bring remaining sauce to a boil. 
                    Mix meat and cilantro into sauce. Serve with white rice.</li>
            </ol>
