    <h4>Mojo Chicken, a staple in Cuban cuisine, stands out for its 
        tantalizing combination of freshness and depth. The greatness of 
        this dish lies in its marinade, a vibrant blend of citrus juices 
        and garlic, which infuses the chicken with a burst of tangy, zesty 
        flavor, while hints of oregano and cumin add a subtle warmth. 
        This marinade not only tenderizes the chicken but also imparts 
        a bright, aromatic quality that's both invigorating and comforting. 
        As the chicken cooks, it absorbs these complex flavors, resulting 
        in a dish that's succulent and bursting with a unique blend of 
        sweetness, acidity, and spice. Mojo Chicken is more than just a 
        meal; it's a celebration of the fresh, bold flavors that define 
        Cuban cuisine.</h4>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
            <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
            <li>2 medium oranges, zested</li>
            <li>1 medium lime, zested</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, 
                cilantro, garlic, orange zest, lime zest, oregano, 
                salt, pepper, cumin, and bay leaves in a large resealable 
                bag. Add chicken thighs, coat with marinade, squeeze out 
                excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 
                for at least 6 hours or overnight. Flip the bag over 
                occasionally and rub over chicken thighs to evenly 
                distribute marinade.</li>
            <li>Place chicken and marinade in a slow cooker. Cook on 
                Low until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the 
                juices run clear, 4 to 5 hours. An instant-read thermometer 
                inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F 
                (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
